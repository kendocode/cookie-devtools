Developer cookie manager with real-time monitoring, environment profiles, and one-click export to curl. No tracking.

### Detailed Description
Cookie DevTools is a developer-focused cookie manager built for debugging, testing, and environment switching.

Unlike basic cookie editors, Cookie DevTools gives you the tools developers actually need: a real-time monitor that shows cookie changes as they happen, environment profiles to save and switch between cookie states, and one-click export to curl, cookie files, or raw headers.

Features:
- View, add, edit, and delete cookies for the current site
- Real-time cookie change monitor with cause tracking (explicit, expired, evicted, overwritten)
- Environment profiles — save and restore named cookie snapshots
- Export to JSON, cookie file (curl/wget), curl command, or Cookie header string
- Visual attribute badges: Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite, Session
- Search and filter across cookie names, values, and domains
- Dark mode with system preference auto-detection
- No tracking, no ads, no data collection

Perfect for:
- Debugging authentication flows
- Switching between dev/staging/prod cookie environments
- Generating curl commands with session cookies
- Monitoring how websites set and modify cookies
- QA testing cookie behavior across environments
